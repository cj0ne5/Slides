## Grading - Jeff's Classes

- First Quarter: Certification Exam. If you pass the exam, you get an A
- Rest of the year:
    - Students will receive a weekly cumulative letter grade that will incorporate daily quizzes, tests, projects, and presentations. These weekly evaluations can be challenged by the student, but only during the week immediately following when the evaluation is given.
    - The average of the weekly evaluations will make up 70% of the final grade, with the course final exam making up 30%.
